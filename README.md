Quantum Cryptography and Integration in EVM Hybrid Chain

QUALNET, the pioneering quantum cryptographic blockchain, proudly announces a transformative upgrade to its EVM hybrid chain, reinforcing its position as a leader in quantum-resistant security. 
We have integrated advanced quantum cryptographic codes, featuring two state-of-the-art post-quantum proof signature verification algorithms: ML-DSA-87 and Dilithium Mode 5.
This strategic enhancement ensures that QUALNETâ€™s blockchain infrastructure is fully equipped to withstand the computational power of quantum computers, safeguarding crypto assets, banking systems, IoT networks, and end-to-end encrypted communications.
